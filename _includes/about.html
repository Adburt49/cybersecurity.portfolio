        <p>  Cybersecurity Analyst
    </P> Cybersecurity trailblazer with a passion for safeguarding digital landscapes. Pursuing a Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and equipped with a solid foundation in healthcare, I blend compassion and tech-savviness to create a unique professional profile.<P>

</P> My journey began as a curious teenager fascinated by coding and Linux. After a stint as a home health aide and mother of two, I returned to tech with renewed focus and drive. I’ve honed my attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and time management skills.<P>
  
</P>
      </P>Managing patient care required strict adherence to privacy and compliance standards, seamlessly translating to maintaining data confidentiality and regulatory compliance in cybersecurity.<P>
